      VDUs have been blamed - often wrongly - for a wide range of health problems. In fact, only a small proportion of VDU users actually suffer ill health as a result of their work. Where problems do occur, they are generally caused by the way in which VDUs are being used, rather than the VDUs themselves. So problems can be avoided by good workplace and job design, and by the way you use your VDU and workstation.</h3>
      <h3 class="body1"><br />
        <strong>Are aches and pains caused by using a VDU? What about RSI?</strong><br />
        Some users may get aches and pains in their hands, wrists, arms, neck, shoulders or back, especially after long periods of uninterrupted computer work. Repetitive strain injury(RSI) has become a popular term for these aches, pains and disorders, but can be misleading - it means different things to different people. A better medical name for this whole group of conditions is upper limb disorders. Usually these disorders do not last, but in a few cases they may become persistent or even disabling.</h3>
      <h3 class="body1"><br />
        <strong>How can I avoid these aches, pains and disorders?</strong><br />
        Problems of this kind may have a physical cause, but may also be more likely if a VDU user feels stressed by the work (see next question). If you get aches or pains you should alert your supervisor or line manager. Problems can often be avoided by good workplace design, so that you can work comfortably, and by good working practices (like taking frequent short breaks from the VDU). Prevention is easiest if action is taken early, before the problem has become serious.</h3>
      <h3 class="body1"><br />
        <strong>What can be done to reduce stress in my computer work?</strong><br />
        People who use a VDU sometimes complain of stress, but this usually arises from increased pace of work or pressure to meet deadlines, not the VDU itself. Some computer workers find stress reduced because the VDU makes their job easier or more interesting, but for others stress becomes worse. This can happen when a system does not work well or when the user does not feel in control or competent to operate it.Employers can help overcome stress by providing the right training, and by designing systems and tasks to match the abilities of the people who work with them.</h3>
      <h3 class="body1"><br />
        <strong>Can work with VDUs affect eyesight?</strong><br />
        Extensive research has found no evidence that VDUs can cause disease or permanent damage to eyes. But long spells of computer work can lead to tired eyes and discomfort. Also, by giving your eyes more demanding tasks, it might make you aware of an eyesight problem you had not noticed before. You and your employer can help your eyes by ensuring your VDU is well positioned and properly adjusted, and that the workplace lighting is suitable. Ask for an eye test if you still think there is a problem.</h3>
      <h3 class="body1"><br />
        <strong>What about problems with my contact lenses or bifocals?</strong><br />
        The heat generated by computers and other equipment can make the air seem drier, and some contact lens wearers find this uncomfortable. If you have this problem but don't want to change to spectacles, you can try blinking more often or using tear-substitute drops. Where the air is dry, employers can help by taking steps to increase the humidity.People with bifocal spectacles may find them less than ideal for computer work. It is important to be able to see the screen easily without having to raise or lower your head. If you can't work comfortably with bifocals, you may need a different type of spectacles. Consult your optician or doctor if in doubt.</h3>
      <h3 class="body1"><br />
        <strong>Can computer work cause headaches?</strong><br />
        Headaches may result from several things that occur with computer work, such as:<br />
        ▪ screen glare;<br />
        ▪ poor image quality;<br />
        ▪ a need for different spectacles;<br />
        ▪ stress from the pace of work;<br />
        ▪ anxiety about new technology;<br />
        ▪ reading the screen for long periods without a break;<br />
        ▪ poor posture; or<br />
        ▪ a combination of these.<br />
        Many of these things can easily be put right once the cause of the problem has been found.</h3>
      <h3 class="body1"><br />
        <strong>How long should I work with a VDU?</strong><br />
        There is no legal limit, but you need to break up long spells of computer work. How long you should work without a break depends on the type of work you are doing. See pages 4 and 6 for further information.</h3>
      <h3 class="body1"><br />
        <strong>Do VDUs give out harmful radiation?</strong><br />
        No. VDUs give out both visible light, which enables us to see the screen, and other forms of electromagnetic radiation which can be harmful above certain levels. However, the levels of radiation emitted from VDUs are well below the safe levels set out in international recommendations. So your employer doesn't have to check radiation levels from your VDU, and you do not need any special devices such as spectacles, screens or aprons when using it.</h3>
      <h3 class="body1"><br />
        <strong>What should I do if I'm pregnant?</strong><br />
        You don't need to stop working with VDUs. Past concern, about reports of miscarriages and birth defects among some groups of computer workers, has not been borne out by more recent research. Many scientific studies have now been carried out and, taken as a whole, these do not show any link between miscarriages or birth defects and working with VDUs. If you are anxious about your VDU or about work generally during pregnancy, you should talk to your doctor. Or you could talk to someone who is well informed about current scientific information and advice on VDUs.</h3>
      <h3 class="body1"><br />
        <strong>Can working with VDUs cause skin disorders?</strong><br />
        This is rare. A few people have experienced irritation, rashes or other skin problems when working with a VDU. The exact cause is not known, but it seems possible that a combination of dry air, static electricity and individual susceptibility may be involved. If this is the case, increasing the humidity or allowing more fresh air into the room may help.</h3>
      <h3 class="body1"><br />
        <strong>Can VDUs trigger epileptic fits?</strong><br />
        Most people with epilepsy are completely unaffected by VDUs. A few who suffer from photo-sensitive epilepsy and are susceptible to flickering lights and striped patterns may be affected in some circumstances. But even they can often work successfully with VDUs without provoking an attack.</h3>
      <h3 class="body1"><br />
        <strong>I use a portable computer - are there any precautions I should take?</strong><br />
        Laptops and other portables have to be compact and easy to carry. The resulting design features, like small keyboards, can make prolonged use uncomfortable, unless steps are taken to avoid problems, e.g. by using a docking station. It is best to avoid using a portable on its own if full-sized equipment is available. And like other VDU users, people who habitually use a portable should be trained how to minimise risks. This includes sitting comfortably, angling the screen so it can be seen clearly with minimal reflections, and taking frequent breaks if work is prolonged. Wherever possible, portables should be placed on a firm surface at the right height for keying.</h3>
      <h3 class="body1"><br />
        <strong>Is it true that using a mouse can cause problems?</strong><br />
        Intensive use of a mouse, trackball, or similar pointing device may give rise to aches and pains in the fingers, hands, wrists, arms or shoulders. This can also happen with a keyboard, but mouse work concentrates activity on one hand and arm (and one or two fingers), and this may make problems more likely. Risks can be reduced by adopting a good posture and technique.Try to limit the time you spend using the mouse. Take frequent breaks - even short pauses to relax your arm can help, as can spells using the keyboard or doing non-computer work. Place the mouse close, so it can be used with a relaxed arm and straight wrist. It can help to support your arm, for example on the desk surface or arm of a chair. If you still find using the mouse awkward, you could try a different shaped or sized one, or another device such as a trackball.</h3>
      <h3 class="body1"><br />
        <strong>Who is affected by the Regulations?</strong><br />
        The Regulations apply where staff habitually use VDUs as a significant part of their normal work. Other people, who use VDUs only occasionally, are not covered by the requirements in the Regulations (apart from the workstation requirements). However, their employers still have general duties to protect them under other health and safety at work legislation.</h3>
      <h3 class="body1"><br />
        <strong>I am self-employed - am I covered?</strong><br />
        The Regulations do not place any duties on the self-employed. However, parts of them apply if you habitually use a VDU for a significant part of your normal work and are using a client employer's workstation. The client employer has to assess and reduce risks, ensure the workstation complies with the minimum requirements and provide information, as if you were an employee. But there is no requirement for employers to plan work breaks, or provide eye tests or training for the self-employed.</h3>
      <h3 class="body1"><br />
        <strong>When I work at home - am I covered?</strong><br />
    Yes, the Regulations apply if you are an employee working at home, and habitually using a VDU for a significant part of your normal work.</h3></th>
